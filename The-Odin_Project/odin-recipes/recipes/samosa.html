        <li>
            <h3>Cook Potato</h3>
            <p>
                To cook the potatoes in a stovetop pressure cooker: 
                Place 3 medium-sized whole potatoes (300 to 450 grams) and
                 2 to 2.5 cups water in a 3 or 4 litre pressure cooker.
                  On top of the potatoes carefully set a small trivet and pressure cooker-safe bowl with ½ cup green peas. 
                Pressure cook for 5 to 6 whistles or 7 to 8 minutes on medium to medium-high flame.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Roast and Powder Spices</h3>
            <p>
                Next, roast or toast the spices.
                 This will help to release their flavors and should not be skipped!
                 frying pan over low heat and add spices
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Make Potato Stuffing</h3>
            <p>
                Peel the skin off of the cooked potatoes, and chop them in ½ to 1 inch cubes.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Get them Ready for Serving</h3>
            <p>
                n a small skillet, heat 1 tablespoon oil.
                 When the oil becomes medium hot then reduce the heat to low.
                Crackle ½ teaspoon cumin seeds until fragrant.
                 I used mustard oil as it really adds a punch in the stuffing.
                You can use neutral oil like sunflower oil, safflower oil, grapeseed oil or canola oil.
